ACME::ODB is a MooseX::Declare-based Perl module for computing the "Old Dirty Bastard" quotient of an individual.  Based on the individuals age, it can compute such fun-loving information as:

- The youngest age the individual can date without it being too creepy
- The youngest vintage of Scotch that the individual should drink
- more to come in future releases.
